# Keyboards

If you're here you're probably interested in either, my keybaord designs (ðŸ™Œ)
or, you're thinking about designing your own keyboard (also ðŸ™Œ).

If you've done this before the footprints are in the libs folder as submodules.

If you haven't done this before there are lots of good resources available to
give you a headstart:

- [Designing a keybaord from scratch in KiCad](https://keyboarddweebs.net/2024/01/04/designing-a-keyboard-pcb-from-scratch-using-kicad/)
- [Joe Scotto's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@joe_scotto) - he also
  has a GitHub repo with a bunch of cool stuff in it. The link to that can be
found in the `libs` README.
- [Ben Vallack's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BenVallack)
- [Flat Foot Fox's Ergogen Series](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/)

### A note on Ergogen
While Ergogen appears to be a simple way to design a mechanical keyboard, it can
be difficult to grep, especially given the docs are not easy to read and aren't
complete.

The Flat Foot Fox series is a good way to learn Ergogen though it does have some
limitations. Designing a split ergo in Ergogen seemed more convoluted that
necessary so I preferred to go straight into KiCad using the "Designing a
Keyboard from scratch" article and Joe Scotto's videos for reference.
