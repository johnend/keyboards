# Tomahawk Split Ergo Keyboard

**N.B. The content of what is in this repo is in the early design phase, and
so should not be considered remotely usable at this point.**

The Tomahawk is a split ergo keyboard designed to be low profile, and have a
large number of thumb keys.

The main intention for me was to ensure I could mirror my Cyboard Imprint build
as closely as possible while making something low profile and portable (because
Dactly type keyboards are great, but also massive).

## Features

- Split ergo design with USB connectivity (maybe wireless in the future),
- 6 thumbs keys in a two row, three column, layout, that allows for lots of
  thumb use,
- An additional **mod row** that allows for mapping ctrl, alt, and super
  separately (or to whatever you want),
- Large memory with support for many layers
- Per key RGB (optional),
- RGB backlighting (optional),
